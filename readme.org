* QUIC in Odin
Quic implementations are coming along very slowly. So here's a VERY VERY VERY WIP implementation in Odin.

** How to use this library
You cannot use it yet. It is not at all done.

** Why?
Because I can, or at least I think I can.

** Can I help?
Sure, if you want. 

* Goals
Right now this is in the early phase of implementation. I am just trying to get it to work.

The ulimate goal is to have a fast, lock-free, zero-copy implementation, in which data is read from the
socket and decrypted in place, and passed on to whatever associated process requires it (or otherwise
dropped).

I intend to use a single arena per datagram as my memory allocation strategy, but that
is very much in flux. I think there may be more thought needed to put that in, but being
able to free all memory used in the process of decryption is my intent for right now.
